<h1>Security Information</h1>

<p>
If you wish to report a new security vulnerability in PostgreSQL, please
send an email to
<a href="mailto:security@postgresql.org">security@postgresql.org</a>.
For reporting non-security bugs, please see the <a href="/account/submitbug">Report a Bug</a> page.
</p>

{%if version and not version.supported%}
<h1>UNSUPPORTED VERSION</h1>
<p>
You are currently viewing security issues for an unsupported version. If
you are still using PostgreSQL version {{version}}, you should upgrade as
soon as possible!
</p>
{%else%}
<p>

The PostgreSQL Global Development Group (PGDG) takes security seriously,
allowing our users to place their trust in the web sites and applications
built around PostgreSQL. Our approach covers fail-safe configuration options,
a secure and robust database server as well as good integration with other
security infrastructure software.
</p>

<p>
PostgreSQL security updates are primarily made available as <a href="/support/versioning">minor version</a>
upgrades. You are always advised to use the latest minor version available,
as it will likely also contain other non-security related fixes. All known
security issues are always fixed in the next major release, when it comes out.
</p>

<p>
PGDG believes that accuracy, completeness and availability of security
information is essential for our users. We choose to pool all information on
this one page, allowing easy searching for vulnerabilities by a range of
criteria.
</p>

<p>
Vulnerabilities list which major releases they were present
in, and which version they are fixed in for each. If the vulnerability
was exploitable without a valid login, this is also stated. They also
list a vulnerability class, but we urge all users to read the description
to determine if the bug affects specific installations or not.
