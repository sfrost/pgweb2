Please ensure you have read the
<a href="/docs/current/static/bug-reporting.html">bug reporting guidelines</a>
before reporting a bug. In particular, please re-read the
<a href="/docs/current/static/">documentation</a> to verify that what you are
trying is possible. If the documentation is not clear, please report that, too;
it is a documentation bug. If a program does something different from what the
documentation says, that is also a bug.</p>

<p>Poor performance is not necessarily a bug. Read the documentation or ask on
one of the <a href="/community/lists/">mailing lists</a> for help in tuning
your applications. Failing to comply to the SQL standard is not necessarily a
bug either, unless compliance for the specific feature is explicitly claimed.</p>

<p>Before you continue, check on the
<a href="https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Todo">TODO list</a> and in the
<a href="https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Category:FAQ">FAQ</a> to see if your bug is already known. If you cannot
decode the information on the TODO list, report your problem so we can clarify
the TODO list.</p>

<p>To report a security bug, please send an email to
<a href="mailto:security@postgresql.org">security@postgresql.org</a>. All
other bugs will be forwarded to the
<a href="/list/pgsql-bugs/">pgsql-bugs</a> mailing
list where they will be publicly archived.</p>

<p>Make sure you are running the latest available minor release for your major
<a href="/support/versioning/">version</a> before reporting a bug. The current
list of supported versions is
{%for ver in supportedversions%}{{ver}}{%if not forloop.last%}, {%endif%}{%endfor%}.
</p>

<p>This bug report form should only be used for reporting bugs and problems
with the PostgreSQL database.  Problems with database connectors such as ODBC
and JDBC, graphical administration tools such as pgAdmin or other external
projects <strong>should not be reported here</strong>; please report to those projects
directly.  For products closely connected with PostgreSQL, there may be an
appropriate <a href='/community/lists'>mailing list</a> available.

<p>
By submitting a bug through this form you agree that all contents of the bug report,
including your personal information as listed, will be posted to the <strong>public</strong>
<a href="/list/pgsql-bugs/">pgsql-bugs</a> mailing list, and archived in the
<strong>public</strong> list archives.
