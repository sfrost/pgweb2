<h2 class="major"><span>Who are we?</span></h2>

<p>A PostgreSQL database developer is someone who is actually working on the project, not someone using it to develop
an application or a website. We don't hire programmers, we reach across the Internet, drawing the best database
developers in the world to PostgreSQL. Read about the <a href="/community/contributors">people behind PostgreSQL</a> and
check out the <a href="/files/community/conference06/conference_group.html">group picture</a> from the 2006
PostgreSQL Anniversary Summit.
