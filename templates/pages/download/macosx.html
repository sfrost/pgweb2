<p>
PostgreSQL is the default database on macOS Server as of OS X Server version 10.7.
macOS without the macOS Server add-on installed includes only the PostgreSQL
libpq shared library.
</p>
<p>
macOS Server 10.12 ships with PostgreSQL 9.4. Minor updates are provided
by Apple, but not necessarily right after a new PostgreSQL minor release.
</p>
<p>
There are several other installers available for PostgreSQL on macOS,
which is the recommended way to install.
</p>

<h2>Interactive installer by EnterpriseDB</h2>

<p>
<a href="http://www.enterprisedb.com/products/pgdownload.do#macosx"> Download the installer</a>
certified by EnterpriseDB for all supported PostgreSQL versions.
</p>

<p>
This installer includes the PostgreSQL server, pgAdmin; a graphical tool for managing and developing
your databases, and StackBuilder; a package manager that can be used to download and install
additional PostgreSQL tools and drivers. Stackbuilder includes management,
integration, migration, replication, geospatial, connectors and other tools.
</p>

<p>
This installer can run in graphical, command line, or silent install modes.
</p>

<p>
The installer is designed to be a straightforward, fast way to get up and running with
PostgreSQL on macOS.
</p>

<p>
<em>Advanced users</em> can also download a
<a href="http://www.enterprisedb.com/products/pgbindownload.do">zip archive</a>
of the binaries, without the installer.
This download is intended for users who wish to include PostgreSQL as part of another application installer.
</p>

<h3>Platform support</h3>

  The installers are tested by EnterpriseDB on the following platforms.
  They will generally work on newer versions of macOS as well:
