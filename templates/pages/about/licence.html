<h2>Why not the GNU General Public License?</h2>
<p>People often ask why PostgreSQL is not released under the GNU General
Public License. The simple answer is because we like our license and do not
want to change it. If you are keen to read more about this topic, then please
take a look in the <a href="/list/">Archives</a> at

debate on the subject!
