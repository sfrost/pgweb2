<h1>About PostgreSQL <img id="logo" src="/media/img/about/press/elephant.png" alt="PostgreSQL Elephant Logo" /></h1>

<h2 class="major"><span>What is PostgreSQL, anyway?</span></h2>
<p>
  PostgreSQL is a powerful, open source object-relational database system. It has more than 15 years
  of active development and a proven architecture that has earned it a strong reputation for
  reliability, data integrity, and correctness. It runs on all major operating systems, including
  Linux, UNIX (AIX, BSD, HP-UX, SGI IRIX, Mac OS X, Solaris, Tru64), and Windows. It is fully ACID
  compliant, has full support for foreign keys, joins, views, triggers, and stored procedures (in
  multiple languages). It includes most SQL:2008 data types, including INTEGER, NUMERIC, BOOLEAN,
  CHAR, VARCHAR, DATE, INTERVAL, and TIMESTAMP. It also supports storage of binary large objects,
  including pictures, sounds, or video. It has native programming interfaces for C/C++, Java, .Net,
  Perl, Python, Ruby, Tcl, ODBC, among others, and exceptional documentation.

<h2 class="major"><span>Why use PostgreSQL?</span></h2>
<p>
  An enterprise class database, PostgreSQL boasts sophisticated features such as Multi-Version
  Concurrency Control (MVCC), point in time recovery, tablespaces, asynchronous replication, nested
  transactions (savepoints), online/hot backups, a sophisticated query planner/optimizer, and write ahead
  logging for fault tolerance. It supports international character sets, multibyte character encodings,
  Unicode, and it is locale-aware for sorting, case-sensitivity, and formatting. It is highly scalable both
  in the sheer quantity of data it can manage and in the number of concurrent users it can accommodate.
  There are active PostgreSQL systems in production environments that manage in excess of 4 terabytes of
  data.
