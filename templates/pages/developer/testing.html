<h2>QA and Performance </h2>
<p>
We have two performance labs. One is located in Portland Oregon at <a href="http://www.commandprompt.com">Command Prompt's</a> facility. The other is located in France at the OpenWide facility.
These facilities are used for a wide range of tasks from DBT-style tests, to system monitoring and feature specific testing. You can review more information at the <a href="https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Performances_QA_testing">Performance and QA testing wiki page.</a>
