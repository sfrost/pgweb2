<h1>Versioning policy <i class="fas fa-code-branch"></i></h1>

<p>
<i>We always recommend that all users run the latest available minor release for whatever major version is in use.</i>
</p>

<p>
PostgreSQL major releases include new features and occur roughly once every year. Beginning with version 10, a major release is indicated by increasing the first part of the version, e.g. 10 to 11.  Before version 10, a major release was indicated by increasing either the first or second part of the version number, e.g. 9.5 to 9.6.
</p>

<p>
Major releases usually change the internal format of system tables and data files.  These changes are often complex, so we do not maintain backward compatibility of all stored data.  A dump/reload of the database or use of the <a href="/docs/current/static/pgupgrade.html">pg_upgrade</a> module is required for major upgrades.
</p>

<p>
Minor releases are numbered by increasing the last part of the version number.  Beginning with version 10, this is the second part of the version number, e.g. 10.0 to 10.1; for older versions this is the third part of the version number, e.g. 9.5.3 to 9.5.4. The PostgreSQL team only adds bug fixes to minor releases. All users should upgrade to the most recent minor release as soon as possible. While upgrades always have some risk, PostgreSQL minor releases fix only frequently-encountered, <a href="/support/security">security</a>, and data corruption bugs to reduce the risk of upgrading. <i>The community considers not upgrading to be riskier than upgrading</i>.
</p>

<p>
A tentative schedule for upcoming minor releases can be found in the
<a href="/developer/roadmap/">roadmap</a>.
</p>

<p>
Upgrading to a minor release does not require a dump and restore; merely stop the database server, install the updated binaries, and restart the server.  For some releases, manual changes may be required to complete the upgrade, so always read the release notes before upgrading.
</p>

<h2>PostgreSQL release support policy</h2>
<p>
The PostgreSQL project aims to fully support a major release for
<b>five years</b>. After its end-of-life (EOL) month ends, a major version receives one final <a href="/developer/roadmap/">minor release</a>. After that final minor release, bug fixing ceases for that major version.
</p>

<p>
After a release falls out of full support, we may (at our committers'
discretion) continue to apply further critical fixes to the source code,
on a best-effort basis. No formal releases or binary packages will be
produced by the project, but the updated source code will be available
from our source code control system.
</p>

<p>
This policy will be followed on a best-effort basis. In extreme cases it
may not be possible to support a release for the planned lifetime; for
example if a serious bug is found that cannot be resolved in a given major
version without significant risk to the stability of the code or loss of
application compatibility. In such cases, early retirement of a major
version may be required.
