<h1>Your account</h1>
<p>
From this section, you can manage all information on this site connected
to your PostgreSQL community account. Other than your basic profile
information, this includes news and events, professional services and
comments. Note that most of the data you submit to this site needs to be
approved by a moderator before it's published.
</p>
<p>
To submit a new record, or to edit an existing record, select the
type of record in the menu on the left.
</p>

<h2>Permissions model</h2>
<p>
News, Events, Products and Professional Services are attached to an
Organisation. One or more persons can be given permissions to manage
the data for an organisation. If you do not have permissions for an
organisation and think you should have, you need to contact the current
managers for that organisation. You can find a list of organisations
and managers <a href="orglist/">here</a>.
</p>

<h2>Migrated data</h2>
<p>
For most of the data migrated from the old website has unfortunately not
been connected to the proper organisations and accounts. If you have any
data submitted that is not properly connected to you (most likely this
will be your account not being connected to the proper organisation(s)),
please contact <a href="webmaster@postgresql.org">webmaster@postgresql.org</a>
and let us know which objects to connect together.
