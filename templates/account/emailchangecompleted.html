Your email has successfully been changed to {{user.email}}.

<p>
Please note that if you are using your account from a different
community site than <em>www.postgresql.org</em>, you may need to log
out and back in again for the email to be updated on that site.

<p>
The token <code>{{token}}</code> was not found.
</p>
<p>
This can be because it expired (tokens are valid for approximately
24 hours), or because you did not paste the complete URL without any
spaces.
</p>
<p>
Double check the URL, and if it is correct, restart the process by
clicking "change" in your profile to generate a new token and try again.
